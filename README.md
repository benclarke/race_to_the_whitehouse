###Race to the White House 2016!

Play one of five GOP candidates for president as they race to the White House in this mind-blowing satircal game.

But watch out for gaffes, skeletons in the closet and the Ghost of Mitt Romney, among other things, 
as you try to go from Far Right to Center Right before running out of campaign cash. 

Good luck!
